# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Report: 
For this course assignment I chose to remake the homepage of a bankwebsite called Storebrand. I thought it would be nice to remake it since I eventually want to apply for a job in that company. 
I chose to code in react, so I could practice more on working in react and because I find it better and easier to work with. 

I started with setting up the project in vs code and added all the components on the page. Then I saved all the images from the website and the icons that was going to be used. When all that was done I started to code one component at the time and made them all responsive. I struggled a bit to make it completely identical and also making everything responsive to mobile form, and used most of the time on that. I still have a few thing that I am not finished on the page, and I also want to make the login page and maybe one more page so I have more to show on a future jobinterview.
